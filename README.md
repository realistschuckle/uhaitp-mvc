Hi, everybody!

Want to run this code? Great!

Download or clone it. You may choose to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as
a convenient tool to clone repositories from GitHub.

Once you have it, open a command line and, in Windows, type these instructions:

```
cd «to your folder»
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

PROFIT!
