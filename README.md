# uhaitp-mvc

Hi, everybody!

Want to run this code? Great!

## How to get this code

Download or clone it. You may choose to use [GitHub
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as a convenient tool to clone repositories
from GitHub.

If you want to clone this, then make sure you install `git` on your computer.
Then, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/realistschuckle/uhaitp-mvc.git
```

This will place all of the code into a directory named `uhaitp-mvc` from
wherever you wrote that code.

## How to run the code

Once you have it, open a command line and, in Windows, type these instructions:

**For Windows**
```
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=development
cd «to your folder»
dotnet restore
dotnet watch run
```

**For macOS**
```
cd «to your folder»
dotnet restore
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=development dotnet watch run
```

## No more CTRL+C stop and restart when you change C# code!

I've added a "watcher" so that as you change your code, the code will
automatically recompile.

PROFIT!
